{"introduction":"Keeping up with newest developments and innovations in the continually growing arena of academic study is hard challenge. There is a crucial need for effective categorization and classification techniques due to the increase of research papers publications in variety of fields. Researchers, scholars, and academic institutions are always looking for novel ways to organize and retrieve research papers, making them more accessible and relevant to their specific interests. From this project it will introduce a novel approach to address this challenge. Topic Modeling for Research Paper Classification: A Text Classification Approach. the main purpose is to extract research paper\u2019s meaningful topics through topic modeling and categorize those topics into predefined research domains or themes using text classification. To do that will use LDA (Latent Dirichlet Algorithm) and SHINE (short text classification model). End result of this project will be a system that can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of research paper management and discovery. This proposal outlines the key components of the project, including problem domain, comparing with the existing work, Aim, Research questions and the proposed solution, objectives, scope in and scope out, requirements, tentative plan and risks."}
