{"abstract": "To effectively monitor the spending, we offer an advanced expense tracker. Everyone who plans to know their expenses and save from them will benefit from our approach. Receipts can be entered by the user, and our application will classify them using AI. Here, the user may also create their own categories like food, clothes, rent, and bills, as well as establish upper and lower bounds for each category. This project is not intended for a specific user demographic or age range; rather, it is available to anyone who wishes to keep track of their spending. So, the overall goal of this project is to assist users in viewing and analyzing their overall spending behavior by creating a mobile application that can analyze all of the user's transactions simply by scanning their receipts"}
